// Real frame animation for a lane object: swaps the quad's texture on a timer,
// picking the next frame at random rather than marching through them in order.
//
// This is what LaneWalker's own class comment said could not be done — "a
// literal per-species animation would need several consistent hand-picked
// frames, which independent AI generations can't reliably match each other's
// style/proportions for". That held for text-to-image, where every call
// invents the character again. Feeding the existing sprite back in as an
// image-to-image edit and changing only the pose keeps one character across
// all frames, so the objection no longer applies.
//
// Frames must share a canvas size (they are exported aligned bottom-centre on
// one, see asset_gen) — the quad is scaled once from the first frame's aspect
// and never touched again, so a differently-shaped frame would visibly stretch.
