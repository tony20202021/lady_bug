// Swaps the snake's sprite between a rearing "cobra" pose while idle and a
// slithering zigzag pose while crossing lanes (LaneWalker.IsMoving) — the
// one bad object where a genuine pose swap made more sense than the
// wiggle-only animation every other wandering creature uses (see
// LaneWalker's own comment): the two states actually look different, not
// just more or less animated. Rescales the sprite quad's width to match
// each texture's own aspect ratio so swapping poses doesn't stretch/squash
// the art — height stays fixed since that's what the collider was sized from.
