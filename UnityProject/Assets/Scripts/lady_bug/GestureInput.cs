// keyboard simulator (ReadHand(), still the only option when
// UseRealSensors == false, e.g. the "Имитатор" controller choice).
//
// Gestures (assumes the player faces the screen, sensors mounted above each
// hand, looking straight down):
//   both hands down             -> duck
//   one up, one down            -> lean toward whichever hand is down
//   both hands flapping rapidly -> jump/flight (a held "both up" alone does
//                                  nothing — it has to be the flapping motion)
// No accelerate/brake gesture anymore — the road accelerates on its own
// (SpeedController) and braking was removed from every control scheme.
