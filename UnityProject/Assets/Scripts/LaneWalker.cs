// A few living bad objects (dog/cat/crow) drift sideways between lanes at
// random — eases from the current lane's centre toward a random neighbour's
// centre, which naturally passes through both lanes' edges along the way,
// then waits before picking another lane. Purely lateral (X); MovingEntity
// still handles the forward (Z) scroll.
//
// Also doubles as this object's animation: a slow idle wiggle while sitting
// in a lane (standing in for "dog scratches an ear" / "bird pecks" — a
// literal per-species animation would need several consistent hand-picked
// frames, which independent AI generations can't reliably match each
// other's style/proportions for), and a faster, more obvious wiggle while
// actively crossing into a neighbouring lane.
